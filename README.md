# Alfred AI FastAPI Project Management API

This project is a Project Management API built with FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, and SQLite. The API allows users to manage projects and their associated tickets. Forked by wrudnicki16 to test Github Actions.

## .env Instructions

Create a `.env` file in the `app/` directory with the following contents:

```env
APP_ENV=dev
```

## Using the Dockerfile

### Build the Docker Image
To build the image, navigate to the root directory of the project and run:

```bash
docker build -t <image_name> .
```

### Run the Docker Image
To run the docker container with the environment variables, run:

```bash
docker run --env-file app/.env -p 8000:8000 <image_name>
```

This command will:
- Use the environment variables in the `.env` file
- Map the container's port 8000 to the host's port 8000
- Run the container in the background
- Start the FastAPI application with the `dev` flag for FastAPI (separate from the environment variable to enable debug mode)

# Project Management API Documentation

The Project Management API is designed to facilitate the management of projects and tickets within those projects. It provides a set of endpoints for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting both projects and tickets.
